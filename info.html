        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh pursuing a Bachelor of
          Science in Computer Science with an expected graduation date of April
          2025. Originally from Long Island, New York, I have been passionate
          about computer science and technology for as long as I can remember.
          My academic journey has been driven by a strong desire to expand my
          skills and knowledge in the field. <br />
          <br />
          Throughout my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in
          programming and algorithms. I am eager to apply my learning in
          practical settings and contribute to innovative work. I seek to
          continue to grow as a computer scientist and utilize my skills within
          the tech industry/ research. <br />
          <br />
          I am excited about opportunities to collaborate and explore the
          exciting world of technology and computers!

        <h3>Why the site?</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to get experience using HTML and CSS. The website also has a
          dash of JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h3>Why this style?</h3>
        <p>I wanted the website to have a retro feel to it.</p>
